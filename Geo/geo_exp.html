				</h1>
            <p>
                The "Dead End Road" is a two-player game, played by a blue player and a green player.

            </p>
            <p>
                The game's opening screen is shown below. 

            </p>
            <img src="images/tutorial/GEO_0.jpg" alt="geo0" height="300">

            <p>
                Players alternate turns, where at each turn the active player chooses a vertex that is connected to the vertex chosen in the previous turn. 

            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the image below, vertex 26 is the initial vertex.
            </p>
            <img src="images/tutorial/GEO_0.jpg" alt="geo0" height="300">
            <p>
                You will be the first player to choose a vertex.
            </p>

            <p>
                The starting vertex is colored in grey. You should choose one of the vertices that can be reached by one of the green arrows.

            </p>
            <h3>The Goal</h3>
            <p>
                A player wins the game by choosing such that the other player is “stuck” at a dead end, that is, there are no vertices that can be chosen.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>An example of a situation where the player Green won: </b>
                You can see the last vertex, vertex 32, has arrows going out but since all the destinations of vertex 32 points have been selected,
                     this is a dead end vertex.
            </p>
            <img src="images/tutorial/GEO_2.jpg" alt="geo0" height="300">
            <p>
                When there are green arrows, it is your turn to choose a vertex.
When blue arrows appear, it is your opponent's turn.
            </p>

            <p>In your turn, choose a vertex that can be reached  by a green arrow, by clicking the vertex</p>

            <p>The player whose turn to play is displayed at the bottom.</p>
            <p>
                The image shows a phase of the game when it is the opponent’s turn to choose a vertex (the blue player)


            </p>
            <img src="images/tutorial/GEO_1.jpg" alt="geo0" height="300">
            <br>
            <h3>The Task</h3>
            <p>In this game you will be the first player (green). Your goal is to choose vertex that guarantees a victory, regardless of the opponent's choices.</p>

            <p>You can simulate your steps and the steps of the opponent on the graph using the interface described earlier.</p>

            <p>
                <b>It is important to highlight that in the interface you play both players. Namely, you select vertices for the green player, and also blue player.
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                When there are green arrows, it is your turn to choose a vertex.
When blue arrows appear, it is your opponent's turn.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <h3>Submit your answer</h3>
            <p>At any time, you can select at the bottom of the page the first vertex which will guarantee that you (the green player) wins, as follows:</p>
            <img src="images/tutorial/GEO_choose.png" alt="geo0">


            <p>
                At any stage, you can backtrack as many steps as you want by clicking the "UNDO MOVE“ button, or by clicking on the vertex you selected last.
            </p>
            <img src="images/tutorial/undo.png" alt="geo0" align="center">

            <p>
                You can also click the "RESET" to get a clean graph to clear the graph from all the moves that were chosen.

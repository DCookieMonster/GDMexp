            <p>
                                <p>“The traveling salesman“ game is a single player game. </p>

                
                <p>Each vertex on the graph is analogous to a City and the edges are analogous to roads between the cities. </p>

                <p>
                    The purpose of the game is to choose a route that visits all cities without visiting any of the cities more than once.
                </p>
                <h3>Opening Page</h3>
                <p>Your route can start from any city in the graph. </p>
                <p>
                    You can mark the starting point of the route - by clicking one of the cities.
                </p>
                <img src="images/tutorial/TSP_0.jpg" alt="tsp0" style="height: 224px; width: 267px">
                <h3>Possible Actions</h3>
                <p>
                    You can choose a city by clicking on a vertex.
Once you select a city, edges (roads) leading to your next possible destinations (cities) will be colored green.
                </p>

                <p>The blue arrows mark the route you have taken so far.</p>

                <p>You can move forward in completing your route by selecting one of the cities that are connected to green edges (roads). </p>

                <p>
                    In the example screenshot, it can be seen that the route started at city 1 and the last action was choosing city 5. The next possible destination cities are 2,3 or 4.
                </p>
                <img src="images/tutorial/TSP_1.jpg" alt="tsp0" style="height: 233px; width: 259px">

                <p>
                    At any stage, you can backtrack
as many steps as you wish by clicking on 
 the last selected city, or by clicking 
the "UNDO MOVE“ button.
                </p>
                <img src="images/tutorial/undo.png" alt="tsp0" style="height: 35px; width: 88px">


                <p>
                    Once you have completed a route that you think is correct,  submit it by clicking the "Continue" button.
Once you’ve submitted your solution you will not be able to change it.
                </p>
               

                <h3>The Task</h3>
                <p>Your task is to choose a route that connects all cities without passing through the same city more than once. </p>

                <p>
                    An example correct solution is shown in the screenshot
                </p>

                <h3>Note</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have already visited all cities that are connected to the selected city, green pathways will not appear since additional destinations are no longer accessible (as you cannot visit a city more than once).

            <p>
                                <p>“The traveling salesman“ game is a single player game. </p>

                
                <p>Each vertex on the graph is analogous to a City and the edges are analogous to roads between the cities. </p>

                <p>
                    The purpose of the game is to choose a route that visits all cities without visiting any of the cities more than once.
                </p>
                <h3>Opening Page</h3>
                <p>Your route can start from any city in the graph. </p>
                <p>
                    You can mark the starting point of the route - by clicking one of the cities.
                </p>
                <img src="images/tutorial/TSP_0.jpg" alt="tsp0" style="height: 224px; width: 267px">
                <h3>Possible Actions</h3>
                <p>
                    You can choose a city by clicking on a vertex.
Once you select a city, edges (roads) leading to your next possible destinations (cities) will be colored green.
                </p>

                <p>The blue arrows mark the route you have taken so far.</p>

                <p>You can move forward in completing your route by selecting one of the cities that are connected to green edges (roads). </p>

                <p>
                    In the example screenshot, it can be seen that the route started at city 1 and the last action was choosing city 5. The next possible destination cities are 2,3 or 4.
                </p>
                <img src="images/tutorial/TSP_1.jpg" alt="tsp0" style="height: 233px; width: 259px">

                <p>
                    At any stage, you can backtrack
as many steps as you wish by clicking on 
 the last selected city, or by clicking 
the "UNDO MOVE“ button.
                </p>
                <img src="images/tutorial/undo.png" alt="tsp0" style="height: 35px; width: 88px">


                <p>
                    Once you have completed a route that you think is correct,  submit it by clicking the "Continue" button.
Once you’ve submitted your solution you will not be able to change it.
                </p>
               

                <h3>The Task</h3>
                <p>Your task is to choose a route that connects all cities without passing through the same city more than once. </p>

                <p>
                    An example correct solution is shown in the screenshot
                </p>
                <img src="images/tutorial/TSP_2.jpg" alt="tsp0" style="height: 225px; width: 264px">
                <h3>Note</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have already visited all cities that are connected to the selected city, green pathways will not appear since additional destinations are no longer accessible (as you cannot visit a city more than once).
                </p>

                <h3>Voting on solutions offered by others</h3>
                <p>
                    After you submit your solution, you will be presented with solutions to this game that were proposed by other people. You will be asked to determine, for each solution, whether it is correct or incorrect.

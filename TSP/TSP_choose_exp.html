                                <p>“The traveling salesman“ game is a single player game. </p>

                
                <p>Each vertex on the graph is analogous to a City and the edges are analogous to roads between the cities. </p>

                <p>
                    The purpose of the game is to choose a route that visits all cities without visiting any of the cities more than once.
                </p>
                <h3>Opening Page</h3>
                <p>Your route can start from any city in the graph. </p>
                <p>
                    You can mark the starting point of the route - by clicking one of the cities.
                </p>
                <img src="images/tutorial/TSP_0.jpg" alt="tsp0" style="height: 224px; width: 267px">
                <h3>Possible Actions</h3>
                <p>
                    You can choose a city by clicking on a vertex.
Once you select a city, edges (roads) leading to your next possible destinations (cities) will be colored green.
                </p>

                <p>The blue arrows mark the route you have taken so far.</p>

                <p>You can move forward in completing your route by selecting one of the cities that are connected to green edges (roads). </p>

                <p>
                    In the example screenshot, it can be seen that the route started at city 1 and the last action was choosing city 5. The next possible destination cities are 2,3 or 4.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At any stage, you can backtrack
as many steps as you wish by clicking on 
 the last selected city, or by clicking 
the "UNDO MOVE“ button.
                </p>
                <img src="images/tutorial/undo.png" alt="tsp0" style="height: 35px; width: 88px">


                <p>
                    Once you have completed a route that you think is correct,  submit it by clicking the "Continue" button.
Once you’ve submitted your solution you will not be able to change it.
                </p>
               

                <h3>The Task</h3>
                <p>Your task is to choose a route that connects all cities without passing through the same city more than once. </p>

                <p>
                    An example correct solution is shown in the screenshot

                <h3>Note</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have already visited all cities that are connected to the selected city, green pathways will not appear since additional destinations are no longer accessible (as you cannot visit a city more than once).
                </p>

                
            <h3>Explanations:</h3>

<b>Solution 5</b></br> 
<img src="images/exp/exp4.png" style="height: 400px; width: 430px" >
</br><b>Explanation</b></br>
         <p>You have to begin on an interior vertex. Taking the perimeter first will lead to insoluble complications. The chief difficulties are in the loop around vertex 68 and the backtracking of 26 and 50. Beginning at 68 alleviates this and allows 50 to be visited without leaving a deadend.</p>

<b>Solution 6</b></br> 
<img src="images/exp/exp5.png" style="height: 400px; width: 430px" >
</br><b>Explanation</b></br>
         <p>The trick to this solution is to visit the cities in the middle triangle first, because that's the part of the puzzle where you can easily get stuck (because there's no road between 68 and 38). So I started there, and from there it was simple getting to all the other cities one by one.

<b>Solution 7</b></br> 
<img src="images/exp/exp6.png" style="height: 400px; width: 430px" >
</br><b>Explanation</b></br>
        <p>I started at point 38 which only has two options, from there I traced from 62, 68, 32, to 41.  At 41 you can chose to go two directions, but I chose to go to the area where I had trouble earlier.  I connected to 47, 44, 35, 65 then up to 59.  I then traced to 50, 26, 29, 53, and finally finished at 56.  I made sure none of my paths intersected with previous hubs.</p>

      </br><b>Explanation</b></br>
         <p>The trick to this solution is to visit the cities in the middle triangle first, because that's the part of the puzzle where you can easily get stuck (because there's no road between 68 and 38). So I started there, and from there it was simple getting to all the other cities one by one.

        <p>I started at 56, then went to 26, 50 and then 59. Once at 59, I went down to 65 and then across to 35, then 44 and 47. Once at 47 I went to 41, 53 29, 32, 38, 62 and ended at 68. Didn't visit any place twice, quick and easy.</p>

</br><b>Explanation</b></br>
        <p>I started at point 38 which only has two options, from there I traced from 62, 68, 32, to 41.  At 41 you can chose to go two directions, but I chose to go to the area where I had trouble earlier.  I connected to 47, 44, 35, 65 then up to 59.

<b>Solution 5</b></br> 
<img src="images/exp/exp4.png" style="height: 400px; width: 430px" >
</br><b>Explanation</b></br>
         <p>You have to begin on an interior vertex. Taking the perimeter first will lead to insoluble complications. The chief difficulties are in the loop around vertex 68 and the backtracking of 26 and 50. Beginning at 68 alleviates this and allows 50 to be visited without leaving a deadend.</p>
